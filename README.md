# Start Discord Website
This is the official website, which is hosted on vercel. [Website](https://startweb.vercel.app)

Note that you have switched to the dev branch, which does do changes. This is not free of bugs like main, and this may have issues. But the good side is you will get early features! [Dev Build](https://earlystartweb.vercel.app)
## Point of bot
The bot is for people to start of a server with ease. (get it? start?)
## Developer(s)
The original dev, toasta (website & bot) made everything! And another guy, kidus, made me think I should do this. Shoutout to him
ANOTHER guy, sodacat/sobacat gave me some ideas! Really overall, 2 guys made this
