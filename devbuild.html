    <h1><strong>Confused on a Dev Build?</strong></h1>
    <p>A dev build (short for developer build), is used to test things. Some other discord bots like sapphire have one <strong>(well I don't really know tbh)</strong>.</p>
    <h1><strong>Is this build always head of the main branch?</strong></h1>
    <p>No, it's not. It's a dev branch, where the Toasta/Developers test out pre-release things. Like a alpha build for sapphire (that's in their discord so it's real.)</p>
