      <h1><strong>News</strong></h1>
      <p><i>TL;DR</i>- A sad thing happened. We lost the code for all of Start Development Discord Bot. (and yes that is the name internally)</p>
      <p><i>All of what happened - <strong>Saturday, November 4th at 8:19 PM EST</strong></i> We were planning to release a major update (2.0). We were deleting the old version of Start Discord Bot, when we messed up. We thought we were in the <i>1.0</i> container, but we actually weren't. We deleted the container named<i>Start Discord (Pre-release 2.0)</i>. As you can tell, that wasn't good. We lost all of our work. But we still had a 1.0 release. And guess what. My friend had I transferred the 2.0 to a new one, so he deleted 1.0.</p>
      <br>
      <p>All of this is apart of the Start Development Discord Bot project.</p>
